# Unity-SuperSonicRaceBall

Somewhat of a "Sanicball"-Clone, but with the goal of adding **Online-Multiplayer**, and **procedural terrain generation** *someday*.

## Licensing
I'm not sure how to handle my assets from the unity store. (I use a free premade skybox asset). **Please contact me, if i have violated your IP, i will pull down the affected content ASAP**
The long term goal is to make this project open-source and Free for Everyone with either self-made assets or Creative Commons.

### UPDATE 1  - Going Public
##### 30.7.2019
As of now, all efforts torward procedural terrain generation will be stopped, my original plan was to generate an **unaltered map based on perlin-noise-octaves**, but this is proving to complicated for now (i suspect a simple bug in my "path"-classifier, but i am done writing sanity checks for my code)
While i reevaluate the generation process, i will work on other exciting features: If everything goes well, i can move to alpha in the next few Days and start work on the **online-multiplyer**.
