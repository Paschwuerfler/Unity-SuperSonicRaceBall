#Unity-Sanciball
Somewhat of a "sanicball"-Clone, but with the goal of adding **Online-Multiplayer**, and **procedural terrain generation** someday.
##This project will be set to public once i figure out if i can do so (project contains unity store assets and i'm to lazy to find out the licensing situation with them right now.
